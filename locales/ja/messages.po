"People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that's great! But it's %1$s and chat is neither of those things. For most people, typing is much slower than talking. So despite best intentions, **you're actually just making the other person wait** for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity (and kinda annoying).\n"

"It may seem trivial, but asking your question before getting that initial salutatory reply also allows for **asynchronous communication**. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a \"Hello\" and wondering what they missed.\n"
